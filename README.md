# Focused Will

## Preface

This guide exists to provide a starting point for Discipline Priest players who are looking to improve their knowledge in the Shadowlands expansion, all information here has been derived from data provided by spreadsheets, logs, and consensus from players that excel in all PvE formats of the game. The spreadsheet used to make a lot of the assumptions here is linked in the sidebar for your convenience, as well as the Focused Will discord. If you have questions about anything here, feel free to ask there.

If you can provide information that could lead to an improvement in what this guide suggests, feel free to do so.

## Quick Start?

This guide is not aimed towards players seeking a quick start guide. We recommend [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/discipline-priest-pve-healing-guide) as they compensate their authors, which usually leads to higher quality information.

_Please do not ask questions in the Discord that could be easily covered by an existing resource such as a guide or video._
