## Preface

This guide exists to provide a starting point for Discipline Priest players to go from at the start of the Shadowlands expansion, all information in this guide has been derived from data provided by spreadsheets, logs, and consensus from players that excel in all PvE formats of the game.

If you can provide information that could lead to an optimisation in what this guide suggests, feel free to do so.

### Quick Start

This guide is not aimed towards players seeking a quick start guide. We recommend [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/discipline-priest-pve-healing-guide) as they compensate their authors, which usually leads to higher quality information.

### Guide Specifics

Where mechanics aren't easily explained, there will be available widgets that will attempt to provide better context to the ideas that are being presented.
