## Best-in-slot

There are two real contenders for the legendary slot right now, as many of the Discipline specific effects are drastically undertuned or function horribly,

### Clarity of Mind

Clarity of Mind provides an extra ~2 Atonements during Spirit Shell and extends your Power Word: Radiance Atonements to last the majority of the Spirit Shell window. This is also beneficial as it allows you to cast Mindbender the global before activating Spirit Shell without losing a huge amount of useful Atonement seconds during the Spirit Shell window. The mana component is somewhat small, saving only a few percent of mana per cycle.

### Twins of the Sun Priestess

Fairly self explanatory, allows you to cast Power Infusion without completely losing the effect yourself. This effect sucked in Legion, but may be powerful if you require a burst of DPS and healing at the same time. M+ players should consider crafting this first, as bursts of damage requirement and healing intake are commonly linked together.
