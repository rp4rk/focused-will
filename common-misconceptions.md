> This page documents and debunks several misconceptions regarding the Discipline specialization.

## Damage/Healer Hybrid

Probably the most common misconception about Discipline is that it exists in a state where it provides half the damage of a DPS and half the healing of a healer. This has never been the case and Discipline has always existed to fill a healer slot and compete in that category with every other healer in the game.

It's understandable as to how this misconception started, because healing on a Discipline Priest requires that you press damaging buttons. This is not the fabled '50%' damage, it simply allows Discipline to continue providing DPS during periods of intense damage (see: [Atonement](discipline?id=atonement) ), which is a fairly unique benefit of the specialization.

Look at the following image, it depicts the statistics for Mythic Shad'har the Insatiable on October the 19th, 2020.

We can see that while Discipline _does_ provide the most passive DPS - Restoration Druids have a higher maximum output capacity. Which points to an overall more nuanced situation than Discipline being better for damage in every single situation. This means that simply analyzing the output of specializations on a website such as Warcraft Logs does not give the full picture. This problem is further exaggerated by the inclusion of game contexts such as M+, where Discipline provides significantly less damage on AOE packs than most other healers.

## Difficulty

Discipline has a reputation for being one of the more difficult healers in the game, and while this is true to an extent it's commonly agreed upon by players that it is not _the_ hardest healer.

Discipline has a higher skill floor for casual players, as in order to begin playing the spec effectively it requires you to create mouseover keybinds or use an addon such as Clique. By doing this you facilitate the ability to heal players without switching targets, eliminating the time penalty. **Creating mouseover macros for healing is not considered a unique requirement, and every other healer also benefits from them.**

## "Handling Mistakes"

Discipline has a lot of tools that allow it to "_handle mistakes_" in group content and beyond, including one of the most powerful flash heals in the game in the form of [Shadow Mend](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=186263/shadow-mend). Shadow Mend can be further amplified by other effects such as [Shadow Covenant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314867/shadow-covenant) or [Twist of Fate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265259/twist-of-fate).

The following is a list of powerful healing effects that can be used to burst raw EHP gains onto players,

- Friendly [Penance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=47540), potentially with [Power of the Dark Side](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198068)
- [Rapture](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=47536/) with [Power Word: Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=17)
- [Shadow Mend](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=186263/)
- [Shadow Covenant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314867/shadow-covenant)

Arguably, Discipline has a stronger set of reactionary healing than Holy Priests, as not only are they not constrained by cooldowns such as [Holy Word: Serenity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2050) - they have the benefit of being able to stack several optional healing buffs.
