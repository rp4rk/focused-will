> This page documents and debunks several misconceptions regarding the Discipline specialization.

## Damage/Healer Hybrid

Probably the most common misconception about Discipline is that it exists in a state where it provides half the damage of a DPS and half the healing of a healer. This has never been the case and Discipline has always existed to fill a healer slot and compete in that category with every other healer in the game.

It's understandable as to how this misconception started, because healing on a Discipline Priest requires that you press damaging buttons. This is not '50% of a DPS' damage, it simply allows Discipline to continue providing DPS during periods of intense damage (see: [Atonement](discipline?id=atonement) ), which is a fairly unique benefit of the specialization.

Look at the following image, it depicts the statistics for Mythic Sire Denathrius on May 12th, 2021:

At the moment we can see that Holy Paladins have a higher typical output capacity combined with a _higher_ average output capacity, on top of this Monks have significantly closed the gap through the use of the Ancient Teachings of the Monastery legendary. Which points to an overall more nuanced situation than Discipline being strong for damage in every single situation. This means that simply analyzing the output of specializations on a website such as Warcraft Logs does not give the full picture. This problem is further exaggerated by the inclusion of game contexts such as M+, where Discipline provides significantly less damage in AoE situations, and situations where incoming damage is easily handled without groups.

To add to this, other healers have the capability of working with a Druid using Heart of the Wild to convoke as Restoration - facilitating increased levels of DPS during high damage intake moments.

## Difficulty

Discipline has a reputation for being one of the more difficult healers in the game, and while this is true to an extent it's commonly agreed upon by players that it is not _the_ hardest healer.

Discipline has a higher skill floor for casual players, as in order to begin playing the spec effectively it requires you to create mouseover keybinds or use an addon such as Clique. By doing this you facilitate the ability to heal players without switching targets, eliminating the time penalty. **Creating mouseover macros for healing is not considered a unique requirement, and every other healer also benefits from them.**

## "Handling Mistakes"

Discipline has a lot of tools that allow it to "_handle mistakes_" in group content and beyond, including one of the most powerful flash heals in the game in the form of [Shadow Mend](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=186263/shadow-mend). Shadow Mend can be further amplified by other effects such as [Shadow Covenant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314867/shadow-covenant) or [Twist of Fate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265259/twist-of-fate).

The following is a list of powerful healing effects that can be used to burst raw EHP gains onto players,

- Friendly [Penance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=47540), potentially with [Power of the Dark Side](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198068)
- [Rapture](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=47536/) with [Power Word: Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=17)
- [Shadow Mend](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=186263/)
- [Shadow Covenant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=314867/shadow-covenant)

Arguably, Discipline has a competitive set of reactionary healing tools as Holy Priests, as not only are they not constrained by cooldowns such as [Holy Word: Serenity](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2050) - they have the benefit of being able to stack several optional healing buffs.
