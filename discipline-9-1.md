# Discipline in 9.1
Going into the next patch, Discipline is looking to be fairly different. The gameplay radically changes, with an emphasis on more complex ramp windows that are farther spaced than in Castle Nathria. This means Discipline needs to perform larger mini ramps, and simultaneously maintain the strength of their larger main ramp in order to remain competitive.

As always with guides for content that hasn‚Äôt been released yet, all this information is subject to change, but with the amount of change that is looking probable this document should point you in the right direction for the next patch. 

## Notable Changes
Spirit Shell is now a 90 second cooldown, up from 60 seconds. The implications here aren‚Äôt quite as dire as one might expect, as this opens up more time between ramps to play with Power Word: Radiance charges. Nonetheless, Discipline can no longer easily play to 1 minute timers, which has been a wildly successful strategy in Castle Nathria. The good news here is that from initial testing, one minute timers seem to be fairly rare in the Sanctum of Domination.

### Discipline Viability 
The changes are obviously an HPS nerf to Discipline Priest, which is already in a very weak position outside of their ramp compared to every other healer in the game. The flip side of this is that as you now ramp on a 1.5 minute interval, your ‚Äúmini ramp‚Äù can include two Power Word: Radiances, resulting in larger mini-ramps. 

As we have a unique way of countering the most problematic barrier to progress, i.e. the ability to substantially increase the raids effective health pool every 1.5 minutes, Discipline will still have a raid spot for important fights in Sanctum of Domination.

## Covenant
The Covenant of choice in 9.1 is _likely_ to change to Kyrian. This is not a suggestion made lightly as the level of effort involved in changing is significant. This also means a lot of the effort you have put in to progress your Venthyr-specific conduits have been largely wasted due to the nature of when those conduits were made obtainable. As a result of this, players should focus on levelling Kyrian to renown 40 in the remaining time of patch 9.0.5, and getting the maximum rank of Courageous Ascension possible.

### Why?
The rationale here revolves around the core principle of dividing cooldowns into ramp windows. The last timer change as significant as this was the change of Evangelism from a 1m 15s cooldown to 1m 30s. This changes what we can cover, but also has ramifications for our other cooldowns fitting into that timer.

For example, when Mindbender is available for every Spirit Shell without holding the cooldown - is it really worth it to condense output into every third Spirit Shell with Boon of the Ascended vs. opting for consistency? The vast majority of Discipline Priests in patch 9.0 have demonstrated that the answer there is ‚Äúno‚Äù.

If we change the calculus slightly for 9.1 with the new cooldown timer - ::Boon of the Ascended is now available for every other Spirit Shell::. Now the answer seems to be a little harder to determine. If we also consider holding Mindbender and Mindgames comes at a significant mana opportunity cost (upwards of 10% every few minutes), anyone that has played Discipline can see how the spec is not playable without several Innervates at that point.

### How Big of a Difference is it?
By simulating various ramp scenarios with Spirit Shell, a standard Boon of the Ascended ramp with the Clarity of Mind legendary does around 30,200% spellpower across 20 players. For comparison, a Mindgames ramp with no pet active does around 13,500% spellpower to 20 players.

If you average these figures across the 20 players, BotA does around 1500% spellpower and Mindgames provides around 675% - so less than 50% as effective.

### Legendaries?
#### Clarity of Mind
Clarity of Mind remains the best legendary available, as it allows the extension of more Atonements into the range of your Ascended Eruption. Players will want to have enough Soul Ash to craft Clarity of Mind on the ring slot, and immediately switch to using it as soon as they obtain a Domination socket on their chest item. 

> More information about Domination sockets is coming soon.  

#### Spheres‚Äô Harmony
Sphere‚Äôs Harmony might see play, potentially combined with the Mikanikos soulbind in order to push the cooldown on Boon of the Ascended down to a minute. There‚Äôs also potential to play this legendary on fights with two minute timers, which introduces the capability of playing Mindbender again and having exceptionally large ramps every 2 minutes to counter mechanics.

> Spheres‚Äô Harmony has its own cast sequence for maximising Boon value into Spirit Shell, stay tuned for that.  

### Can I Still Play Venthyr?
After a lot of review by myself and Smallpriest, there‚Äôs simply not a world in which you can incorporate the current Discipline choices into a Spirit Shell build in 9.1 and expect to perform competitively. That‚Äôs just how the numbers have panned out, it sucks and recommending radical change between patches like this is always introduces uncertainty, but the difference is convincing enough.

If you remain Venthyr your shells will be roughly half of a Kyrian priest. The only option to make that not be the case by holding Mindbender will put you significantly behind on mana, which is a bad idea now that you now want to mini ramp every 45 seconds so you aren‚Äôt holding Mindgames for its full cooldown duration.  Basically, even on a fight with ideal timers - which doesn‚Äôt seem to happen in Sanctum of Domination, you‚Äôre not going to experience the 45 second ramp dream gameplay unless you can get several Innervates to enable it.

There are no reversals that are possible with Mindgames in the Sanctum of Domination. On top of that, the best Soulbind has been relatively nerfed by the introduction of an end tier trait that is only active for 1 hour every day and is probably less output than an ‚Äúokay‚Äù Kyrian mid tree trait. 

## Talents
### Cya Mindbender üëã
As Discipline is extremely mana starved and Mindbender is tied to your mana economy, it is not feasible to hold this cooldown for 30 seconds as Shadow Priests might. This means that our favourite squid is taking back seat to Power Word: Solace or Shield Discipline, with a strong preference to the former.

#### Why?
Mindbender returns half the amount of mana as a Shadowfiend per swing, and lasts 3 seconds less. We are likely to pick up Rabid Shadows as the third potency conduit on Discipline. With an assumed 30% haste (not unreasonable for going into SoD progress), this will result in a swing speed of around 900ms.

With these figures in mind, a Mindbender represents around 6.5% mana per use, and a Shadowfiend represents 17% mana. If you get three uses as you would expect, Mindbender results in a roughly mana neutral situation - meaning the choice between slightly worse mana economy and output is fairly clear. In a 9.1 scenario, you get 25% less mana than _just_ Shadowfiend if you choose to hold Mindbender for your ramp windows. This results in significantly worse mana economy when factoring in Shield Discipline or Power Word: Solace.  

### Evangelism? üò≥
Evangelism can probably see play now on fights where boosting EHP is not a concern, what you may find though is that the passive HPS of more powerful healers may entirely consume Discipline‚Äôs healing outside of ramps due to the incredibly high level of passive HPS in their kits.

What may be more of a concern for Evangelism players is that Spirit Shell serves a much more important role in the goal of progression. This becomes a problem when combined with the consideration of Conduit Energy, and the fact that the Exaltation Conduit is incredibly valuable for the Spirit Shell talent, but the worst Conduit by far with Evangelism slotted.

On top of this, if you encounter a fight where Evangelism is the ideal choice - it‚Äôs quite hard to discern the real benefit over just manipulating Boon of the Ascended to have a better cooldown for the fight. We‚Äôll take more about that when the full Kyrian gameplay guide is released at a later point.

## TL:DR;
As preparation for patch 9.1 you only need to do a few of things,
* Level your Kyrian renown to 40.
* Get the maximum rank of Courageous Ascension you can.
* Grind enough Soul Ash to craft another version of the Clarity of Mind legendary on the ring slot, get more as a bonus.
* Free up a keybind for Power Word: Solace.
