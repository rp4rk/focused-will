Theotar allows you to pick up an early Endurance conduit, which could be incredibly helpful on very early progression content. This comes at the cost of a slightly more RNG initial tree offering however.

Nadjia has an interesting mechanic as her initial tree offering, which may be compelling as a M+ option for players.
