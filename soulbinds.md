## Conduit Considerations
Generally speaking your conduit preference will look something like this:
* Exaltation
* Shining Radiance
* Shattered Perceptions

Shining Radiance and Shattered Perceptions is a toss up largely depending on your typical Atonement count and overhealing on the fight, Shining Radiance has a 20% lead however and if you can make full use of it - do so. Exaltation is significantly ahead (by up to 75%) if you're using Spirit Shell. 

## Progression Soulbinds

Theotar allows you to pick up an early Endurance conduit, which could be incredibly helpful on very early progression content. This comes at the cost of a slightly more RNG initial tree offering however.

Nadjia has an interesting mechanic as her initial tree offering, which may be compelling as a M+ option for players.

## Ideal Soulbind

Draven is the most interesting Soulbind for typical progression content, he allows for a utility switch in his second tier for dispel fights, and has the [Hold Your Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=332754/hold-your-ground) ability which will synergise excellently with Spirit Shell.
