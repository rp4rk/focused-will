## Absorbs are Bad for the Game
Absorbs are bad for the health of healing in competitive environments, absorbs like Spirit Shell are exceptionally bad as not only do they counter entire mechanics pre-emptively, they can do so very often. It was the player's ubiquitous opinion in Warlords of Draenor that they had to go, however that choice has seemingly been reneged on with the focus on Spirit Shell and Shock Barrier as large components of the two most dominant meta healers in Shadowlands.

It remains to be seen how this will turn out, however there are likely going to be two outcomes as we can see by looking to previous balancing of abilities such as Luminous Barrier:
* Spirit Shell is tuned as a competitive option and taken in order to counteract Mythic mechanics, placing the burden of execution before they happen and removing a significant portion of gameplay from Discipline.
* Spirit Shell is bad, and abilities in the baseline kit are tuned around it as it is a spec warping ability to have. Spirit Shell is used as a locus point for arguments involving the potential strength of Discipline in the future.

## Gameplay
### M+ and Spirit Shell

> Never take Spirit Shell in M+ unless you know what you're doing.

Right now, Spirit Shell is incredibly unlikely to be a relevant choice in M+ due to Atonement being significantly weaker in that context. For reference, at the time of writing Rapture can output around 3500% spellpower in 5 globals, something that Spirit Shell can only approach whilst also expending a significant number of your Atonement burst cooldowns such as Schism and Mindgames.

### Mindgames and Spirit Shell
When taken with Spirit Shell, Mindgames should be delayed and used during your Spirit Shell ramp. Otherwise take the Clarity of Mind legendary and use it every 45s, inside your alternating Rapture and Evangelism ramps.

### Power Word: Radiance and Spirit Shell
Power Word: Radiance with the Shining Radiance conduit hits very hard, with this you will likely prefer to cast your Power Word: Radiance inside of Spirit Shell to ensure as much effective healing as possible, however you can optimise your Spirit Shell by moving Power Word: Radiance outside if the healing is likely to be effective during an encounter.

Your largest Spirit Shell possible will probably utilise the Exaltation and Shattered Perception conduits, the Clarity of Mind legendary, and casting Power Word: Radiance before Spirit Shell. This allows you to ramp onto more players, do larger and more evenly spread burst onto them, and have all of it buffed by the Exaltation conduit. This does not necessarily make it better.

### Mindbender and Spirit Shell
Mindbender and Spirit Shell have a very obvious synergy and for once it looks like this may not be a trap to play into. Mindbender has a large HPCT with the amount of Atonements you are looking at during a Spirit Shell ramp (15 or so), so definitely consider it a go-to combination. You also do not want to risk overcapping your Spirit Shell, it remains to be seen how much of a problem this poses.

> Mindbender lasts longer than Spirit Shell's duration, so it makes a lot of sense to press it the global beforehand, and then immediately start using your ramp sequence when you press Spirit Shell.
