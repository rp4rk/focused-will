## Absorbs are Bad for the Game
Absorbs are bad for the health of healing in competitive environments, absorbs like Spirit Shell are exceptionally bad as not only do they counter entire mechanics pre-emptively, they can do so very often. It was the players's ubiquitous opinion in Warlords of Draenor that they had to go, however that choice has seemingly been reneged on with the focus on Spirit Shell and Shock Barrier as large components of the two most dominant meta healers in Shadowlands.

It remains to be seen how this will turn out, however there are likely going to be two outcomes as we can see by looking to previous balancing of abilities such as Luminous Barrier:
* Spirit Shell is tuned as a competitive option and taken in order to counteract Mythic mechanics, placing the burden of execution before they happen and removing a significant portion of gameplay from Discipline.
* Spirit Shell is bad, and abilities in the baseline kit are tuned around it as it is a spec warping ability to have. Spirit Shell is used as a locus point for arguments involving the potential strength of Discipline in the future.

## Gameplay
### M+ and Spirit Shell

> Never take Spirit Shell in M+ unless you know what you're doing.

Right now, Spirit Shell is incredibly unlikely to be a relevant choice in M+ due to Atonement being significantly weaker in that context. For reference, at the time of writing Rapture can output around 3500% spellpower in 5 globals, something that Spirit Shell can only approach whilst also expending a significant number of your Atonement burst cooldowns such as Schism and Mindgames.

### Mindgames and Spirit Shell
When taken with Spirit Shell, Mindgames should be delayed and used during your Spirit Shell ramp. Otherwise take the Clarity of Mind legendary and use it every 45s, inside your alternating Rapture and Evangelism ramps.

### Mindbender and Spirit Shell
In 9.1, Spirit Shell will have a 90 second cooldown - this breaks the previous synergy with Mindbender. A lot of Discipline's mana economy is built into the use of Shadowfiend or Mindbender on cooldown, so it will be incredibly unlikely that it is a good choice to delay Mindbender for Spirit Shell. The opportunity cost of doing so can be upwards of 20k mana, which is extremely significant.
