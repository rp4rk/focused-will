## Core Strengths

Discipline has three "core" strengths it brings that differentiate it from other healers. While each factor is not completely unique when compared across the five other healing specialisations in the game, Discipline is the only healer that brings all three in one player slot. This specific combination has historically made Discipline an exceptional progression healer, and in Shadowlands this role has been slightly contested by Holy Paladin but for the most part remains intact.

### Absorptions

Absorption effects such as Power Word: Shield, Rapture, and Spirit Shell are situational effective health increases that can be strong provided the fight works in their favor. In the following situations, absorbs become significantly better than any other healing effect:

- Reduced max health pool effects, such as the Drained Soul effect on the Azshara fight.
- Reduced healing taken effects, such as the Darkest Depths effect on the Blackwater Behemoth fight.
- Moments of overwhelming incoming damage that would otherwise kill players, such as Dread Arrows on Sylvanas' final platform.

As overwhelming incoming damage is common during early tier progression, Discipline enjoys a favorable bias when being considered in the first weeks of a tier. It's important to note however, that when a tier progresses and stamina becomes higher in relation to the content you're doing, absorption and mitigation become significantly less valuable.

### Atonement

Atonement is a unique mechanic that allows the player to transform their single target damaging spells into healing, meaning that unlike most other healers, Discipline can provide consistent DPS during periods of intense group damage. The counterweight to this is that in order to heal large groups, a player has to "ramp", meaning they spend 10-15 seconds casting preparation spells in order to capitalise on them by dealing damage.

Atonement is a weak source of "small group" healing, and once you take more focused incoming damage, you will no longer be able to continue using Atonement in favor of more direct spells such as Shadow Mend. This means that Atonement can be a weak source of healing unless setup is done in smaller group formats. This issue presents itself in Mythic+, and should be a primary consideration when attempting to tackle any dungeon that has consistently high AoE damage on the group.

Note that other healers can work damage into their spell choice, but outside of a few exceptions this comes at the cost of being able to heal at the same time. This is notable because it is common for Discipline to be outdamaged by another healer that dedicates themselves to doing damage, for example a Holy Priest on a trivial boss that is given full reign to deal damage will typically do _more_ DPS than Discipline can.

### Mitigation

Mitigation is a blanket term for effects that reduce incoming damage before it happens, good examples of this would be Pain Suppression, Power Word: Barrier, and to a lesser extent the "absorption" effect that is applied to an enemy by Mind Blast. Percentage based mitigations, such as Power Word: Barrier, can be extremely powerful depending on the magnitude of incoming damage, allowing players to survive damage that they would otherwise be incapable of surviving. On the other hand, spells such as Mind Blast or Mindgames can provide extremely potent knock-on effects by mitigating the power of a specific attack, such as the leap from Goliaths on the Stone Legion Generals encounter or bosses that heal via damage dealt.

#### Core Mechanics Summary

After reading about Discipline's core strengths, you should be getting an idea of how the specialisation plays. None of Discipline's strengths are reactionary, meaning that it benefits from the structure and planning that goes into the typical execution of a mythic raid encounter. Similarly, some of the new abilities that Discipline brings to Mythic+ are most powerful when planned and used accordingly.

## Core Weaknesses

To contrast the strengths of Discipline, it is also a specialisation that has been consistently weak at specific types of healing since it came into the game in the current iteration. It's important to elaborate on these because unlike specialisations such as Restoration Druid, Holy Paladin, or even _Mistweaver Monk_; Discipline has not got the flexibility present in the available talents to build into something that helps with those weaknesses. 

### Poor Sustained Single Target
Discipline has almost no ways of sustaining high, efficient, single target healing. This is in contrast to specs such as Paladin or Restoration Druid where there are either extremely powerful baseline effects such as Beacon of Light, or legendaries that make single target better. Even Penance, our most efficient single target heal by far, has a slow cast and travel time that strongly discourages use on targets that are likely receive a Holy Shock for example.

### Lack of Offensive Target

This one should be fairly obvious, when a target is not present Discipline loses the ability to group heal effectively. While this has not yet proven to be a significant obstacle for Discipline in raid content, it depends almost entirely on raid fight design and could easily present itself as a problem. A good example would be the immunity mechanic on the Council of Blood which can significantly reduce your healing done by happening during an important cast.

It's worth noting here that specific talents such as Contrition are not considered options when a target is missing, as it's much more optimal to let co-healers heal during these moments and use your limited ramping capabilities when a target is available. As such Contrition should be looked at purely as a way of removing or limiting the opportunity cost of casting a Defensive Penance instead of an Offensive Penance.

### Lack of Friendly Targets

Discipline has a unique target scaling mechanism built into Atonement that other healers do not, each target that has an Atonement will result in a linear increase to healing. Most healing spells in the game, with few exceptions, will reach a ceiling at 6 targets and will not do more healing beyond that. Atonement does not share this limitation, meaning that if you have 20 targets with Atonement, you will do 10x the healing you would be doing at 2 Atonements.

This is a double edged sword, as while Discipline's burst can be large at 20 Atonements, it means that damaging spells are roughly tuned around having that many targets. This leads to Atonement being relatively weaker in formats such as PvP or M+, because there are less targets to "horizontally" scale to. There are some ways to counter this problem, such as by picking Sins of the Many, but they're ultimately not very effective.
