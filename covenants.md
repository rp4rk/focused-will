## Covenant Preface

> Be aware that regardless of Blizzard marketing, your capacity to perform in certain parts of the game will be significantly different depending on your Covenant. This means it's important that you choose the correct Covenant for the game context you are primarily focusing on.

## Covenant Signature Abilities

None of the Covenant signature abilities currently offer a particular synergy with Discipline abilities. Considering this, always defer to popular wisdom when it comes to picks that may counter a specific type of content.

### [Night Fae] Soulshape

> [Soulshape](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=310143/soulshape)

Soulshape provides an instant blink and sustained movement that can reset knockbacks, this could be particularly valuable on a fight that has mechanics such as Kil'jaeden or N'Zoth, where a blink can be the difference between life and death.

### [Kyrian] Summon Steward

> [Summon Steward](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324739)

Summon Steward will give you [Phial of Serenity](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=177278/phial-of-serenity), which does not share a cooldown with Health Potions or Healthstones, meaning that you can use it as another personal every few minutes at worst.

In the best case scenario, you can combine it with some of the more interesting Soulbind effects such as [Ascendant Phial](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=329776/ascendant-phial) in order to skip mechanics that would otherwise incapacitate or take you out of a fight for a while.

### [Venthyr] Door of Shadows

> [Door of Shadows](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=300728/door-of-shadows)

Door of Shadows is a teleport that has a cast time, which reduces how effective it can be in a typical fight. Consider that even with base movement speed, you can move a large portion of the teleport max distance just by pressing `W` instead of casting. This relegates the spell to being used as a planned cheese for specific movement requirements, such as skipping through a beam on N'Zoth or over pustules on Carapace as two examples from the current tier.

[Watch the Shoes](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=336140/watch-the-shoes), a soulbind passive provided by Theotar, could be an interesting way to allow Discipline to work around certain boss mechanics.

### [Necrolord] Fleshcraft

> [Fleshcraft](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324631/fleshcraft)

Fleshcraft is a variable strength EHP boost with various potential benefits based on [conduit choice](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=323074/volatile-solvent) and the presence of adds in a fight.

## Covenant Signature Abilities

All of the damaging Covenant abilities will feed into Atonement. Where Covenant abilities do area-of-effect damage they will only cause Atonement healing for one of the targets hit. This has implications for abilities such as Ascended Nova and Unholy Nova, as despite hitting many targets they do significantly less Atonement Healing than you would expect.

The order suggested here is roughly how you should be considering them for raiding, for M+ you should be considering Boon of the Ascended above everything else.

### [Venthyr] Mindgames

> [Mindgames](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=323673/mindgames)

Mindgames provides a large cooldown that can be used to augment your Atonement healing after ramps. As one of the prevalent Discipline builds will involve using the [Clarity of Mind](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=336067/clarity-of-mind) legendary to enable a full ramp every 45 seconds, the cooldown of Mindgames works excellently for this.

The absorption component of Mindgames has potential to be excellent, it can provide an extremely strong bonus to the damage of the spell by converting the target's healing into damage. This damage **does** follow through to Atonement, meaning that Mindgames on certain encounters may be roughly twice as strong. Additionally, the damage to healing component of the effect also prevents damage from being done in the first place, meaning the value there is double what is listed in the tooltip.

### [Kyrian] Boon of the Ascended

> [Boon of the Ascended](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325013/boon-of-the-ascended)
>
> [Ascended Blast](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325315/ascended-blast)
>
> [Ascended Nova](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325020/ascended-nova)
>
> [Ascended Eruption](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325326/ascended-eruption)

Boon of the Ascended is a large CD that enables a huge amount of damage for 10 seconds, some of which is AoE. This represents a huge increase to Discipline's maximum healing and as such is incredibly valuable for M+ and dungeons.

### [Necrolord] Unholy Nova

> [Unholy Nova](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324724/unholy-nova)

This ability requires significant tuning, or more likely another pass at design in order for it to be competitive.

### [Night Fae] Fae Guardians

> [Fae Guardians](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=327661/fae-guardians)

This ability requires significant tuning, or more likely another pass at design in order for it to be competitive.
