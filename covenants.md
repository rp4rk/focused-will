## Covenant Preface

> Be aware that regardless of Blizzard marketing, your capacity to perform in certain parts of the game will be significantly different depending on your Covenant. This means it's important that you choose the correct Covenant for the game context you are primarily focusing on.

### Pre-launch Update
A set of extremely _low quality_ decisions on behalf of the developers has continued over the last couple of months or so of the beta, in which the [Spirit Shell](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=109964/spirit-shell) ability has been added back. Due to this, and a combination of nerfs intended to hit Spirit Shell but ultimately missing the mark, there is very little reason to believe anything other than Spirit Shell will be competitive in Castle Nathria.

**This has finalised the choice of Covenant for most raiders on the Venthyr, as [Mindgames](#venthyr-mindgames) has exceptional synergy with Spirit Shell.**

For more information, see our page on [Spirit Shell](spirit-shell.md).

## Covenant Signature Abilities

None of the Covenant signature abilities currently offer a particular synergy with Discipline abilities. Considering this, always defer to popular wisdom when it comes to picks that may counter a specific type of content.

### [Night Fae] Soulshape

> [Soulshape](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=310143/soulshape)

Soulshape provides an instant blink and sustained movement that can reset knockbacks, this could be particularly valuable on a fight that has mechanics such as Kil'jaeden or N'Zoth, where a blink can be the difference between life and death. Note that the existence of the Goblin racial, [Rocket Jump](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=69070/rocket-jump) significantly devalues the movement resetting value of this signature ability.

### [Kyrian] Summon Steward

> [Summon Steward](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324739)

Summon Steward will give you [Phial of Serenity](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=177278/phial-of-serenity), which does not share a cooldown with Health Potions or Healthstones, meaning that you can use it as another personal every few minutes at worst.

In the best case scenario, you can combine it with some of the more interesting Soulbind effects such as [Ascendant Phial](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=329776/ascendant-phial) in order to skip mechanics that would otherwise incapacitate or take you out of a fight for a while. Note that this will probably not be exceptional in Castle Nathria as Blizzard have taken special care to flag important mechanics to ignore this, [see here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=318905.3/dwarf-stoneform-and-kyrian-phial-no-longer-removes-some-castle-nathria-bleeds).

### [Venthyr] Door of Shadows

> [Door of Shadows](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=300728/door-of-shadows)

Door of Shadows is a teleport that has a cast time, which reduces how effective it can be in a typical fight. Consider that even with base movement speed, you can move a large portion of the teleport max distance just by pressing `W` instead of casting. This relegates the spell to being used as a planned cheese for specific movement requirements, such as skipping through a beam on N'Zoth or over pustules on Carapace as two examples from the Ny'alotha.

[Watch the Shoes](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=336140/watch-the-shoes), a soulbind passive provided by Theotar, could be an interesting way to allow Discipline to work around certain boss mechanics.

### [Necrolord] Fleshcraft

> [Fleshcraft](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324631/fleshcraft)

Fleshcraft is a variable strength EHP boost with various potential benefits based on [conduit choice](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=323074/volatile-solvent) and the presence of adds in a fight. It is unknown if this will be of any substantial significance in Castle Nathria.

## Covenant Signature Abilities

All of the damaging Covenant abilities will feed into Atonement. Where Covenant abilities do area-of-effect damage they will only cause Atonement healing for one of the targets hit. This has implications for abilities such as Ascended Nova and Unholy Nova, as despite hitting many targets they do significantly less Atonement Healing than you would expect.

The order suggested here is roughly how you should be considering them for raiding, for M+ you should be considering Boon of the Ascended above everything else.

### [Venthyr] Mindgames

> [Mindgames](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=323673/mindgames)

Mindgames provides a large cooldown that can be used to augment your Atonement healing after ramps. As one of the likely Discipline builds will involve using the [Clarity of Mind](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=336067/clarity-of-mind) legendary to enable a full ramp every 45 seconds, the cooldown of Mindgames works excellently for this. Mindgames can also be delayed by 15 seconds to play into Spirit Shell, which is an extremely strong combination.

The absorption component of Mindgames has potential to be excellent, it can provide an extremely strong bonus to the damage of the spell by converting the target's healing into damage. This damage **does** follow through to Atonement, meaning that Mindgames on certain encounters may be roughly twice as strong. Additionally, the damage to healing component of the effect also prevents damage from being done in the first place, meaning the value there is double what is listed in the tooltip.

### [Kyrian] Boon of the Ascended

> [Boon of the Ascended](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325013/boon-of-the-ascended)
>
> [Ascended Blast](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325315/ascended-blast)
>
> [Ascended Nova](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325020/ascended-nova)
>
> [Ascended Eruption](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=325326/ascended-eruption)

Boon of the Ascended is a large CD that enables a moderate amount of damage for 10 seconds, some of which is AoE. This represents a large increase to Discipline's output ceiling and as such is valuable for M+ and dungeons, especially during the Prideful seasonal affix. This Covenant should only be a consideration for players pushing M+ beyond even the weekly level required to get rewards.

### [Necrolord] Unholy Nova

> [Unholy Nova](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=324724/unholy-nova)

> This ability requires significant tuning, or more likely another pass at design in order for it to be competitive.

Unholy Nova costs too much mana, and has extremely poor interactions with Atonement due to the low damage over time component. When you hit many enemies with it, there is no discernable benefit for Discipline as well - meaning the AoE damage component only serves to reduce the effectiveness of this ability due to the use of sqrt scaling. 

### [Night Fae] Fae Guardians

> [Fae Guardians](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/spell=327661/fae-guardians)

> This ability requires significant tuning, or more likely another pass at design in order for it to be competitive.

Fae Guardians has a large amout of the value in the mana return, which is not great when the baseline Discipline spells heal for so little through Atonement, which is Discipline's only method of efficiently converting extraneous mana into output. The cooldown reduction should not be considered, as it will reduce the cooldown of Spirit Shell or Rapture, which in turn become less valuable as they're offset from your cooldowns such as Shadowfiend or Mindbender.

It's also worth mentioning that Venthyr Priests will eventually have an even better method of customising their mana levels in a fight by taking the Theotar Soulbind.
